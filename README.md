# What is this?
This is a Dockerfile put together to test new Ansbile roles on a system a little closer to a stock Debian/Ubuntu server.

Credit and many thanks to [Jeff Geerling](https://github.com/geerlingguy) whose resources for Ansible have been used during the creation of this monstrosity and [gdraheim](https://github.com/gdraheim) for the systemctl Python script to assist in testing systemd services.
